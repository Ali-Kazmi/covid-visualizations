# covid-visualization

These visualizations are for a paper being worked on with Profesor Heinrich Matzinger of Georgia Tech's school of mathematics, Profesor Raphael Hauser from Oxford and Professor Fabio Machado from the University of Sao Paulo. The goal is to understand covid mortality by age. Preprint link here will be added soon. 

Used Python, Pandas, Matplotlib and occasionally Seaborn. The charts focus on age distribution of cases and deaths, for many (many) places.
