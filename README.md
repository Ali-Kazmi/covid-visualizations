# covid-visualizations
Here I'll be putting some visualizations I made in the process of trying to make sense of the covid situation. Uses Python, Pandas, and occasionally Seaborn. The charts focus on age distribution of cases and deaths. 

The main plot is at the top, where I bypass the issues of different sources giving age categories by using some statistics and approximations (Kernal Density Estimation).

More exact histograms are given below.
