# covid-visualizations
Here I'll be putting some visualizations I made in the process of trying to make sense of the covid situation. Uses Python, Pandas, and occasionally Seaborn. The charts focus on age distribution of cases and deaths. 

The main plot is at the top, where I bypass the issues of different sources giving age categories by using some statistics and approximations (Kernal Density Estimation).

Click on the ipynb to view the results and code in github. (Or launch it yourself with google colab or jupyter)
